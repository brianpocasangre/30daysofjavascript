      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      //   const captain = person;
      //   captain.number = 99;
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(cap2);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      console.log(cap3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      // this will only be for the top level/portion anything nested will not
      // be a clone itself it will be referenced to the original and will
      // update original objects nested items. You need a function cloneDeep*
